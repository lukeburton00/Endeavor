# Endeavor Engine

<p> Endeavor is an open source game engine I'm working on in my spare time. Its primary purpose is to expand my abilities as a programmer and experiment with various game engine development concepts. </p>

<p> I've written and rewritten Endeavor using several different game engine design concepts and architectures. To see how my vision for Endeavor has changed, look through the commit history. I previously hoped to build Endeavor as a comprehensive game engine, but more recently have focused on building out core functionality into a simple and easy to use library. </p>

<p> I've used previous iterations of Endeavor to build clones of Pong, Tetris, Conway's Game of Life, and a Falling Sand simulation, and I'm currently working through the tutorials promoted by r/RogueLikeDev using my sprite batcher as a renderer backend. </p>

  <p> In the future, I hope to build a separate engine utilizing Endeavor as its core library. I plan to include several systems that Endeavor used to support, including scenes and entities, as well as adding a level editor. Stay tuned! </p>
