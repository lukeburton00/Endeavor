# Endeavor Engine

<p> Endeavor is an open source game engine I'm working on in my spare time. Its primary purpose is to expand my abilities as a programmer and experiment with various game engine development concepts. </p>

<p> I've written and rewritten Endeavor using several different game engine design concepts and architectures. To see how my vision for Endeavor has changed, look through the commit history. I previously hoped to build Endeavor as a comprehensive game engine, but more recently have focused on building out core functionality into a simple and easy to use library.
  In the future, I hope to build a separate engine to include a scene system, level editor, etc. using Endeavor as its core library. Stay tuned! </p>
