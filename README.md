# Endeavor

<p> Endeavor is an open source game development library I'm working on in my spare time. Its primary purpose is to expand my abilities as a programmer and experiment with various game engine development concepts. </p>

<p> I've written and rewritten Endeavor using several different game engine design concepts and architectures. I previously hoped to build Endeavor as a comprehensive game engine, but more recently have focused on building out core functionality into a simple and easy to use library. </p>

<p> In the future, I hope to build a separate engine utilizing Endeavor as its core library. I plan to include several systems that Endeavor used to support inluding scenes, entity-component-system architecture, and a level editor. Stay tuned! </p>
