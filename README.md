# Endeavor Engine

<p> Endeavor is an open source game engine I'm working on in my spare time. Endeavor is designed to be easy to use, and the codebase is designed to be easily understood. Its primary purpose is to expand my abilities as a programmer, but I hope to see it grow to become a viable tool in the development of 2D games. </p>
